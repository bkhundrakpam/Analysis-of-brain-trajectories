# Analysis-of-brain-trajectories

Using general linear models (GLM), I have analyzed brain trajectories (i.e. age-related changes in brain measures such as cortical thickness, surface area) in health and disease such as Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) and Schizophrenia

Datasets used include:
NIHPD (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/pediatric_mri)
PING (https://chd.ucsd.edu/research/ping-study.html) 
ABIDE (https://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide/)
